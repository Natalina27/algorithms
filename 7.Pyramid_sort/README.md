# Homework
## HeapSort Algorithm

### Target:
> Implement the considered sorting algorithms and compare their efficiency
 
### Description / Step-by-step instructions for completing homework:
- 2 bytes Implement the BubbleSort, SelectionSort, or InsertionSort algorithm (choose two).
- 3 bytes Implement the ShellSort algorithm with three step choices.
- 3 bytes Implement the HeapSort algorithm.
- 2 bytes Test the algorithms, fill in the table according to the measurement results, write your own comparison conclusion, which algorithm is better.
The test file is attached to the task (563 megabytes).
The first line specifies the size of the array, the second line lists the elements of the array separated by a space.
In the result file, write the numbers from the sorted array in one line separated by a space.

- Algorithms should be tested on arrays of the following sizes:
1, 10, 100, 1.000, 10.000, 100.000, 1.000.000, 10.000.000 (this one is optional)

- And with different types of data:
a) random - an array of their random numbers b) digits - an
array of random digits
c) sorted - a 99% sorted array
d) revers - a reverse sorted array
.
Attach a link to your code and to the completed table.
IMPORTANT! When posting an answer, please indicate in which language you completed the PD. This will help us speed up its verification.


Criteria for evaluation:
2 bytes - BubbleSort, SelectionSort or InsertionSort (two to choose from)
3 bytes - ShellSort with three step selection options.
3 bytes - HeapSort.
2 bytes - Testing and output
