# Homework
## Dynamic arrays, incomplete array, priority queue.

### Target:
> Creation of different algorithms for the implementation of the Dynamic Array and comparison of their performance. Create a priority queue or partial array.

### Description / Step-by-step instructions for completing homework:

### 1 task. dynamic arrays.
- Write a method for adding and removing items:
void add(T item, int index);
T remove(int index); // returns the element to be removed
by index in all variants of dynamic arrays:
SingleArray, VectorArray, FactorArray, MatrixArray *.
+3 bytes

### 2 task. Performance comparison table.
Compare the execution time of different operations
for different arrays with different order of values.

make a wrapper over ArrayList() and also compare.
Create a table and attach a screenshot of it.
Draw conclusions and formulate them in several sentences.
+3 bytes

### 3 task. Priority queue (optional).
Write an implementation of PriorityQueue - a priority queue.
Implementation options - list of lists, array of lists
Implementation methods:
enqueue(int priority, T item) - place an element in the queue
T dequeue() - select an element from the queue
+4 bytes

### 4 task. Incomplete array (optional).
Write an Implementation of the class SpaceArray array of arrays with incomplete filling.
Do based on one of the already created arrays and/or lists.
+4 bytes extra.
Write down how much time it took to do your homework.
Only standard arrays [] can be used for implementation
generated array and/or list classes. We do not use standard collections!
IMPORTANT! When posting an answer, please indicate in which language you completed the PD. This will help us speed up its verification.


Criteria for evaluation:
1 task. dynamic arrays. +3 bytes
2 task. Performance comparison table. +3 bytes
3 task (optional). priority queue. +4 bytes
4 task (optional). SpaceArray class +4 bytes
