# 1.Loops_and_Recursion

## Lesson objectives
test programs written in this course:
solve combinatorial problems by enumeration;
use recursion to generate options

## Summary
testing system based on files with data and results;
solving several combinatorial problems for enumeration of options;
rules and features of creating recursive algorithms.

## Competencies
1. Solving the problem by exhaustive enumeration
- Using cycles
- Using recursion
2.  Algorithm Complexity Estimation
- Ability to determine complexity classes of algorithms

# 2.Unit tests

## Lesson objectives
independently check the completed homework according to the prepared tests

## Summary
in this lesson, we will write a system for automatically checking homework and check the first homework using prepared tests;
Let's create a performance table.

## Competencies
Self-checking homework assignments using prepared tests
- Work on the OTUS platform
- Creation of a framework for checking the correctness of homework assignments
